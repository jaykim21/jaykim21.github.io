            <div class="entry-content single-page">
              <p>Betta fish, also known as Siamese fighting fish, labyrinth fish, or Betta splendens, are hugely popular among aquarium hobbyists. Known for their vibrant colors, feisty nature, and long, flowing fins, bettas are exceptionally beautiful fish.</p>
              <p>Originally found in freshwater ponds and streams in Southeast Asia, betta fish have boomed in popularity. Extensive breeding has led to a wide variety of colors and tail fin styles, making betta fish a staple in any pet store.</p>
              <p>However, betta fish are more difficult and expensive to care for than many first-time fish owners expect. Bettas are not starter pets, and they need proper care to thrive. Many betta fish are mistreated in the pet trade.</p>

              <p>The angelfish is a freshwater fish of the cichlid family. There are two types of angelfish: freshwater angelfish and saltwater angelfish. This guide will focus on freshwater angelfish.</p>
              <p>Angelfish are popular among aquarists because of their unique arrowhead bodies with beautiful, flowing fins. Although angelfish are usually peaceful, the fish are known to prey upon small fish and fight amongst fish of their kind, especially during breeding season.</p>
              <p>Angelfish are native to tropical South America, including most of the Amazon water system in French Guiana, Brazil, Guyana, Columbia, and Peru. The fish are commonly found in slow-moving streams, floodplains, and swamps, in warm, acidic water with no salinity.</p>
