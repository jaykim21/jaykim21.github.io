                    <div class="description">
                        <p>Are you thinking of dipping your toes into the water and start keeping fish as pets? They may not cuddle up to you on the sofa or accompany you on walks, but fish are truly fascinating creatures.</p>
                        <p>Fish are more interactive than you might first think. They are entertaining to watch as they navigate their way around a tank, weaving in and out of rocks and plants. They will also rush to greet you at feeding time, coming to the surface for the tasty treats that you drop in.</p>
                        <p>If you are looking for a pet to satisfy a child’s request, then fish are the perfect solution. They are not only easy to keep, but will teach children about being responsible for an animal’s life. From remembering to feed them to cleaning the tank, they will learn the importance of caring for something in order to keep it alive. It may also be an opportunity to ease your child into the subject of death and loss, when the inevitable happens and they discover a fish floating on the surface.</p>
                        <p>So what do you need to think about ahead of getting your first fish?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b><i>The bigger the tank or aquarium the better.</i></b> Most fish may be small in size, but they still need plenty of room to swim, especially if you have decided to get more than one. Whether you’re starting with a single goldfish or a few, browse our wide range of fish tanks for their new home.</li>
                            <li><b><i>Think about where you place your tank.</i></b> Keep it out of direct sunlight, away from windows and heating. The last thing you want is for the water in the tank to heat up out of your control.</li>
                            <li><b><i>Invest in a decent filter.</i></b> This will keep the water in the tank cleaner for longer, removing any debris, pollutants and waste.</li>
                            <li><b><i>Add an air pump.</i></b> This will keep the water in the tank oxygenated and keep it moving which is great for your fish. Pumps come in different sizes depending on the amount of litres your tank can hold. Our range of air pumps can provide a healthier underwater environment for your fish.</li>
                            <li><b><i>Fish may need heat and light.</i></b> Depending on the breed of fish, heating could be crucial. If your fish are tropical there will be certain temperatures that you to need to ensure the water is kept to. Goldfish and cold water fish are an exception and will require no heat. Lighting will help any plant life in the tank to grow and will also show off the colours of your fish for you to enjoy.</li>
                            <li><b><i>Add some gravel to the tank.</i></b> Some bacteria is beneficial to fish and the gravel gives it somewhere to live. It will also help to break down any waste that your fish creates, as well as adding an attractive look to their surroundings.</li>
                            <li><b><i>Include some plants and greenery.</i></b> Using different varieties of plant life will give your fish somewhere to hide and play, helping them to feel safe. Real plants will help to maintain the nutrients in the tank, but artificial plants will work just as well for giving your fish somewhere to hide. Take a look at our great mix of tank ornaments and plants to keep your fish happy!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Fish are a fantastic choice of pet for so many reasons. They are space-saving, in that they have a fixed area of the room and you know where they are at all times! They don’t require walking and they are cheaper to look after than other pets, without the big food costs and vet bills. Fish are fairly low maintenance, although you must allocate time to keep the tank and water in good condition. If the water looks cloudy or smells at all, take action and deal with it, rather than wait for your fish to get ill. They are a quiet species, making no noise, ever! Fish are also known as a stress reliever, with research showing that the relaxing act of watching them swim silently and without conflict will lower blood pressure.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, fish are beautiful breeds that come in all shapes, sizes and colours, making them wonderful to watch. As you get to know your fish, you may discover that they have their own personality, which will help them to become a member of the family!</p>

                            <p>Amid lockdown when going outside was restricted, fish keeping gained popularity as a sustainable hobby. Unlike other pets like canines, there is no need to take fish out for a walk or feed them hefty meals. Apart from these, some major reasons that attract people in fish keeping include-</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>They don’t need a lot of space</li>
                                <li>Don’t make a mess in the house</li>
                                <li>They are silent</li>
                                <li>Require food only a few times a day in small portions</li>
                                <li>Aquariums humidify the air</li>
                                <li>Fish lowers down the stress levels</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you too own an aquarium, understanding the specific requirements of its inhabitants- fish and plants are essential. Every living creature of the tank has optimal conditions for thriving. Therefore, before bringing a new plant or fish home, a thorough knowledge about them is vital. It includes multiple things-</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Temperature requirement</li>
                                <li>Right pH range</li>
                                <li>Light requirements</li>
                                <li>Food and feeding schedule</li>
                                <li>Suitable ambience</li>
                                <li>Compatibility with other species, etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you rely only on the shop owners to get the details, beware! Most of the time, they lie deliberately just to sell their products and do not tell everything about the fish’s and plants’ specific requirements. Therefore, double-checking the information about selected species from different sources like experienced aquarists, online, and literature ensures what is necessary and what’s not.</p>
                            <p>In this article, we are providing important information on some common fish species.
